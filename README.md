# dirtySprayPaint

The scope of the machine is to dirty spray paint.   

The Spray Paint machine to spray paint uses a solenoid [5] to control the air flow coming through the air compressor [4]. A tube connects the solenoid (so the air compressed) to a bucked with the paint, the other cavity of the bucket is connected to the pan tilt [2] which is mounted on the tripod [6]. The pan tilt has a laser to aid the user’s aim [3].

The machine is remotely controlled with a ps3 controller, so when the “X” button is pressed, the solenoid (usually on a close position) moves letting the air flow through the pipe and so filling the bucket.  The air compresses inside the bucket push the paint to the other cavity which is connected to the pan/tilt. The pan/tilt, positioned on top of the tripod, is controlled with the analog thumbsticks (L3), and so it gives directions to the paint.


The Spray Paint machine is powered with a 9V  adapter
