# dirtySprayPaint

The scope of the machine is to dirty spray paint.

The Spray Paint machine to spray paint uses a solenoid [5] to control the airflow coming through the air compressor [4]. A tube connects the solenoid (air compressor) to a pressurize buck paint; the other cavity of the bucket has a tube connected to a nuzzle mounted on top of the pan-tilt [2] mechanism, positioned on the tripod [6]. The pan-tilt has a laser to aid the user’s aim [3].

It is remotely controlled with a joystick; the “X” button allows the air to circulate through the solenoid, usually in a close position; the air goes through the pipe and fills the pressurized bucket. The air compresses inside the bucket push the paint to the other cavity connected to the pan/tilt. The pan/tilt, positioned on top of the tripod, is controlled with the analogue thumbsticks (L3).
The Spray Paint machine is powered with a 9V adapter.
